# Data_Engineering_Project

This capstone project is to demonstrate the knowledge and abilities acquired throughout the Data Engineering course.
This Capstone Project requires working with the following technologies to manage an ETL process for a Loan Application dataset and a Credit Card dataset:

Python (Pandas, advanced modules e.g., Matplotlib), MariaDB, Apache Spark (Spark Core, Spark SQL), and Python Visualization and Analytics libraries. It is expected to set up the environments and perform installations on local machine.
